            <div>Bouldering is a type of rock climbing in which you don't use a rope or harness, but instead climb freely and fall onto a crash pad after finishing. 
                It requires lots of grip strength, balance, and dexterity. There are two ways to boulder: indoors and outdoors. 
                Indoor climbing gyms set specific routes, called problems, and rotate them every so often. 
                Outdoor climbing, however, allows climbers more range in the length and difficulty of climbs. 
                However, it is often more dangerous, especially when climbing a new route.</div>

            <div>Both types of problems are graded on the same two scales. 
                Most of North and South America, China, and Australia use the V Scale, while the rest of Asia and most of Europe use the Font Scale. 
                Grades provide an approximate difficulty level for a specific climb. 
                The V Scale ranges from a V0, the easiest climbs for beginners, to V17, climbs that only a few people in the world have completed. 
                The Font Scale is similar, ranging from 1 to 9A.</div>
