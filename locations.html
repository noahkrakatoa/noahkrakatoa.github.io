            <div>One popular bouldering gym in Austin is the Bouldering Project. 
                It has two locations: one off of Westgate Blvd in southwest Austin, and another off of Springdale Rd on the other side of the city. 
                Both are fairly large, providing tons of climbs for all experience levels. 
                They each also house a full gym, making the $80/month membership well worth the price. 
                Lastly, the Westgate site has a loft with some seating and board games, the perfect place to study or play games after a day of climbing.</div>

            <div>The second most popular climbing gym is Crux. 
                While the Bouldering Project is exclusively for bouldering, hence the name, Crux offers traditional rock climbing as well. 
                They have both automatic and manual belay climbs, along with a huge number of bouldering problems as well. 
                For more experienced or competitive climbers, Crux is the way to go, costing $95/month.</div>
